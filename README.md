# A.T.A.R.I 

# [ All Terrain Arduino Robotic Interface ]

# Introduction

An offroad robot that uses an Arduino nano board with an L298N driver with a hc-06 bluetooth module.
This robot uses three rgb led modules.
One as a headlight another for a break light and a third to make the robot look like a high end gaming pc.

# Chasis

You can use any rc car chasis of your choice that has 2 motors.
A motor that can drive the back wheels, Forward or reverse.
A second motor that turns the left wheels left or right.

# How it works.

The controls of the robot is just like a regular rc car but you can change the speed of the robot,
plus you can control the lights to drive at night. It includes a buzzer which can be toggled wirelessly.
The RGB light cycles automatically and uses the "#random" 
function. It then selects the colour values from a range of o to 255. Each number resembles a different colour
but their is a bug where only certain colours are shown.

When the robot is powered on it will play every nerds favourite tune of retrogaming, The startup of the original
Super Mario bros for the NES.

ONce booted the RGB should start.

The robot is powered by 2 battery packs, A powerpank which plugs directly into the Arduino
